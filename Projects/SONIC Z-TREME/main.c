/****
SONIC Z-TREME v.0.0813 BY XL2
GPL license : If you share a binary version of this, you share back the code.
And please don't be a jerk, just give me some credits somewhere.

Note on this code : it's not pretty, I know!

Note on this build : it was rushed for SAGE 2018. I had no working build in 2018 and wanted to try a new engine using octrees.
I also wrote a custom animation system, which I was proud of (done in like 2 weeks part time, I was very pleased with the results even if it's not user friendly).
THIS VERSION IS POST-SAGE : I did many experiments, so it's not as good as the Sage version.

About the map compiler : It truly sucks. I won't share it for now, I would need to clean it quite a bit, but it really sucks. It started as simple model converter to a collision generator to
a full map compiler. And I did so many experiments, so many different iterations of the engine that it's a real shitshow of unused code, abandonned experiments,
working experiments with terrible code, duplicate functions, etc.
In other words, it's terrible even to myself, so I won't share it yet.
